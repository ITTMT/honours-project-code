# Honour's Project Code Repository

Inside it contains 2 components

* The LSP, containing Lexer / Tokenizer for HTML + CSS (Maybe JavaScript)
* The VS Code Extension to run the LSP on.

Currently the goal is to get the HTML tokenizer working. Then integration to vscode via the extension. 


Other components to the extension will be a concept called a Virtual File View which allows for many files to be collated into a single tab for viewing / editting without the creation of new files.
This see's use in modifying multiple dependent css files in a single html document.
It could have use in OOP languages in displaying parent class Properties / Functions within the child class.

# LSP Example

Heavily documented sample code for https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

## Functionality

This Language Server works for plain text file. It has the following language features:
- Completions
- Diagnostics regenerated on each file change or configuration change

It also includes an End-to-End test.

## Structure

```
.
├── client // Language Client
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── test // End to End tests for Language Client / Server
│   │   └── extension.ts // Language Client entry point
├── package.json // The extension manifest.
└── server // Language Server
    └── src
        └── server.ts // Language Server entry point
```

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in both the client and server folder
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to start compiling the client and server in [watch mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#:~:text=The%20first%20entry%20executes,the%20HelloWorld.js%20file.).
- Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down (if it is not already).
- Press ▷ to run the launch config (F5).
- In the [Extension Development Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension#:~:text=Then%2C%20inside%20the%20editor%2C%20press%20F5.%20This%20will%20compile%20and%20run%20the%20extension%20in%20a%20new%20Extension%20Development%20Host%20window.) instance of VSCode, open a document in 'plain text' language mode.
  - Type `j` or `t` to see `Javascript` and `TypeScript` completion.
  - Enter text content such as `AAA aaa BBB`. The extension will emit diagnostics for all words in all-uppercase.
