# Honour's Project Code Repository

Inside it contains 2 components

* The LSP, containing Lexer / Tokenizer for HTML + CSS (Maybe JavaScript)
* The VS Code Extension to run the LSP on.

Currently the goal is to get the HTML tokenizer working. Then integration to vscode via the extension. 


Other components to the extension will be a concept called a Virtual File View which allows for many files to be collated into a single tab for viewing / editting without the creation of new files.
This see's use in modifying multiple dependent css files in a single html document.
It could have use in OOP languages in displaying parent class Properties / Functions within the child class.
